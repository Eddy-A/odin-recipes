    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br><li><b>2 eggs + water</b> – Michelle uses a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, 
    gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. 
    And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential 
    for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.
    <li> <b>Powdered sugar</b> – The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! 
        Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.
        
    <li><b>Unsweetened cocoa powder</b> – Michelle recommends using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder 
    (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!
